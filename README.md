# AWS-Projects
I documented some explorations of AWS in different labs and projects. Please navigate to different folders to read about specific lab experiences. 

While I have not documented all the labs I completed over hundreds of hours on my GitHub, I will list them below to provide a comprehensive account of my experience. These labs represent a significant portion of my hands-on learning journey.
